# Dragons Gate Staff HUD

The independently versioned Staff edition of the bronze-and-jade Mudlet 5 HUD for Dragons Gate. It displays confirmed `Char.Status`, `Char.Vitals`, and `Room` GMCP values, including `weapon_readied` and `shield_readied`.

Documentation checked for **DGHUD v0.3.90**.

## Quick start

1. Open the Dragons Gate profile you want to use in Mudlet 5.0 or newer.
2. For a fresh installation, paste this into Mudlet's command line:

```lua
lua installPackage("https://github.com/wizzydizzy-ctrl/dragons-gate-staff-hud/releases/latest/download/DragonsGateHUD.mpackage")
```

3. Log into a character. If the HUD does not appear, close and reopen that profile once.
4. Use **OPTIONS** for settings, or enter `dghud help`.

For an existing installation:

```text
dghud check
dghud update
```

`dghud check` reports your installed version without installing. `dghud update` installs only when a newer release exists; an already-current result is normal. Use `dghud refresh` for stale character information, not an update. Automatic updates start **OFF** and your saved choice survives updates. For versions 0.3.15 or older, or a safe-upgrade warning, read [Updates and Recovery](docs/UPDATES_AND_RECOVERY.md) before replacing the package.

## Latest changes — v0.3.90

- `skill combat` shows blue combat skills with uses left.
- `skill utility` shows yellow utility skills with uses left.
- `skill train` shows green skills with zero uses left; it only displays the list and never sends a training command.
- Each filter keeps the full Skills sidebar, sorting, aligned columns, and existing weapon/name filters.

## Feature overview

The header shows the player's local computer time and a synchronized Dragons Gate clock. Game time advances at the configurable 2× default, labels 6:00 AM–5:59 PM as `Daytime` and 6:00 PM–5:59 AM as `Night`, and resynchronizes from startup or manually entered `time` output.

The compact `OPTIONS ▾` control includes Automatic Updates, persistent `HUD TEXT`, and **AUTO MAIN WRAP** toggles, plus Help & Commands, Color Settings, Map Settings, Autoroller, and Support. Automatic updates are off by default. Automatic main-window wrapping is on by default; turn it off to keep full manual control of Mudlet's profile wrap preference. Both choices persist across updates. `HUD TEXT` cycles through Small, Normal, and Large for the side cards without changing the main game-console font. Each section opens its own responsive settings box, so the top menu stays short and every related change can be made in one place. Every highlight is on by default and can be toggled independently in Color Settings: room titles, exits/directions, currency, travel objects, attacks aimed at you, damage received, danger/movement blocks, recovery, ongoing costs, spell threats, and discoveries/loot. Color Settings also lets you add your own literal words or phrases and choose their text color, highlight color, bold, underline, and on/off state. Normal room prose and chat remain unchanged unless a custom phrase matches. Preferences survive HUD reloads and updates without changing personal Mudlet triggers or colors.

Mudlet 5's **Mudlet UI** starter dock belongs to the separate `mudlet-base-ui` package. When that package has no saved show, hide, or stand-aside choice, Staff HUD startup asks it to stand aside for `DragonsGateHUD`. **OPTIONS → MUDLET STARTER UI** shows its actual OFF/ON state: OFF calls `BaseUI.standAside(nil, "DragonsGateHUD")`; ON calls `BaseUI.show()` and remains ON through HUD reloads and updates. An existing explicit choice is preserved. If the package is absent, the option shows **UNAVAILABLE** and explains the problem when clicked. On a BaseUI build without `standAside`, OFF falls back to `BaseUI.hide()`; use `baseui show` to restore that older dock after uninstalling the HUD. The toggle does not hide Mudlet's native game console, input, toolbar, or the HUD's embedded map. See [Mudlet's Base UI manual](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Base_UI) for the dock's own controls and uninstall behavior.

**OPTIONS → Keybindings** enables customizable HUD-owned number-pad controls. The standard layout uses 7/8/9/4/6/1/2/3 for compass movement, 5 for `look`, `+` for `up`, and `-` for `down`; 0, decimal, multiply, divide, and keypad Enter are available but unassigned. On Windows, keep Num Lock on; on macOS, use the actual numeric keypad normally. The feature starts off, leaves the full set inactive if a requested key conflicts with an existing Mudlet key, never deletes personal keys, and preserves choices through updates.

The HUD tracks posture from confirmed game output using the mutually exclusive global variables `standing` and `sitting`. Both begin unknown. Standing messages set `standing=true`; seated, lying, fallen, fainted, and passed-out messages set `sitting=true`. Merely being off balance, knocked back, seeing `You fall...`, or being told to stand does not change posture. The separate `unconscious` variable follows confirmed loss and recovery of consciousness. Matching is substring-safe so command echo and optional social wording do not prevent updates.

The Dragons Gate autoroller is built into DGHUD. It supports both current Character Creator rolling methods: split 11-characteristic rolls in place and 11-value Roll-and-arrange pools. It scores `Awful` through `Great`, `Excel`, and `Superb` as ranks 1–7 across STR, INT, WIS, DEX, AGI, CON, CHA, WIL, PRE, PER, and LUK (77 maximum). Rejected sets use only the fixed safe command `reroll`. For a qualifying arranged pool, choose **Let Me Place**, **Game Auto**, or **My Minimums + Auto** in Options → Autoroller. Manual mode verifies that enabled per-stat minimums can be placed. Game Auto uses the total and optional minimum-Great/minimum-Good-or-Great pool counts, because the game's placement is its own choice. Minimums mode places the configured raw pool labels first and lets Dragon's Gate auto-fill all remaining values; racial or profession modifiers may change the final displayed ranks. Every placement is confirmed by its acknowledgment, reduced pool, and next exact prompt before another command is sent. DGHUD never sends `done`; final acceptance always remains with the player. A qualifying result stays held through `reset` or legacy `clear` display redraws until the player explicitly rerolls or enters a new Step 7 session. The old body-selection flow remains compatible. Initial settings remain target 53, hard stop 62, 0.1-second rerolls, minimum rank 5 for every characteristic, and session plus master logs under the profile's `DGHUDData/og_dg_roller` directory. Options → Autoroller provides a responsive settings form, and Save persists values changed to `off` without editing scripts. Typed commands remain available: `rr start|stop|stats|last|reset|help`; adjust settings with `rr set total 60`, `rr set hard 70`, `rr set max 10000`, `rr set delay .5`, `rr set greats 2`, `rr set goodplus 6`, `rr set arrange manual|auto|minimums`, or `rr set STR 5`. A hard stop intentionally overrides normal pool filters and per-characteristic minimums.

```text
dghud colors
dghud colors room off
dghud colors exits on
dghud colors currency toggle
dghud colors damage toggle
dghud colors spell off
```

Open **OPTIONS → Color Settings → TEXT STYLES** to choose any output highlight, including exit labels, directions, shops/travel objects, each race/class, currency, and version notices. Choose text and optional background colors, bold/underline, or disable that individual style. **SAVE** applies the change to future output; **RESET** restores that style's defaults. Category toggles are on the **CATEGORIES** tab. These choices are saved per Mudlet profile and survive restarts and updates. Unrelated personal triggers remain untouched.

Integrations can read `DGHUD.colors.getStyle("direction")` and save a validated override with `DGHUD.colors.setStyle("direction", {foreground="#74A9FF"})`. Use `DGHUD.colors.setEnabled(false)` for the master toggle; these APIs save the preference before changing the active display and return an error if saving fails.

Run `dghud help` to open the scrollable, color-coded command guide. Everyday commands are green, descriptions are neutral, and potentially destructive package/map cleanup commands are red. The guide closes with its `× CLOSE` button and remains open and properly bounded during window resizing.

Choose **OPTIONS → Refresh Character Data** or run `dghud refresh` whenever inventory, combat values, character details, religion, runes, skills, or time look stale. This reruns only the normal character-data commands; it does not download or reinstall the HUD. `dghud text small`, `dghud text normal`, and `dghud text large` provide the same persistent side-panel sizing as the OPTIONS control, while `dghud text status` reports the current choice.

The HUD runs `info magic` during character startup and whenever that command is entered manually. The shorter `info mag` remains supported for compatibility. All elemental runes are retained, sorted by lowest remaining weaves first, and shown in a scrollable Runes card above Skills. The list height adapts to available space; shorter layouts share Inventory, Runes, and Skills through tabs. Trigger scripts can read `DGHUD.runes.items`, `DGHUD.runes.by_name["force"].remaining`, `DGHUD.runes.remaining.force`, `DGHUD.runes.get("force")`, or `DGHUD.runes.getRemaining("force")`.

## Skills and combat updates

Use `skill` or `skill all` to show every possessed skill. Add a case-insensitive name prefix to narrow only the main output: `skill claw` or `skill clawing` shows Clawing; `skill bite` shows Biting; `skill c` shows all names beginning with C; `skill id` shows Identify skills; `skill ste` shows Stealth. Full names and shortened display names are supported. Each request refreshes the complete saved Skills list, so filtering does not remove anything from the right sidebar. A no-match result says so clearly. Prefix filtering also works with MAIN SKILLS formatting off.

Use `skill weapons` for a grouped list of your Sharp, Blunt, Pole, Throw, and Missile Weapons, plus Biting, Clawing, Breath Weapon, Webbing, and Stinging. It shows only skills your character actually has, using your usual sorting and colors. The sidebar still receives the complete skill list.

Use these exact group filters:

- `skill combat` — non-ready combat rows (blue by default), excluding all zero-use rows.
- `skill utility` — non-ready utility rows (yellow by default), excluding all zero-use rows.
- `skill train` — all zero-use rows (green by default), from either category. Display only; sends no game training command.

These groups ignore case and use skill category and remaining uses, even with customized or disabled colors. Other arguments remain literal name prefixes, and `skill weapons` still includes matching zero-use skills. Every filter affects only one main-display response and keeps the full sidebar list. With **MAIN SKILLS** formatting off, all filters still narrow the raw game output while preserving its row format and order.

**OPTIONS → Skill Settings** keeps the **MAIN SKILLS** formatting toggle (on by default) and separate sorting for **Main Display** and **Right Sidebar**. Each offers **Level**, **Uses**, **Name**, **Number**, **Ready to train (0 uses)**, or **Category (combat vs utility)** as a primary key, ascending or descending order, and an optional secondary key with its own direction. Both default to **Level descending**, then **Uses ascending**; choose **Level** primary and **Uses** secondary for “level then uses.”

Sidebar ordering changes immediately reorder existing rows. Main ordering changes apply to the next complete `skill` output, leaving previously printed tables as they are. Choices are saved for the whole profile and survive character changes, reloads, restarts, and updates. See [Skill Settings](docs/OPTIONS_AND_DISPLAY.md#skill-settings).

Formatted output uses aligned **Number / Skill / LVL / USES** columns. The catalog number is the fixed training ID, not a display rank. Category and Ready to train sorting keep every captured skill visible. Completed blank-ended tables update on the next UI tick without waiting for a later prompt or sending an extra Enter.

Skill rows with **0 uses remaining are green**, combat skills are **blue**, and utility skills are **yellow**. Zero uses takes priority over the skill category. Customize or disable these colors under **OPTIONS → COLOR SETTINGS → TEXT STYLES → Skills**, or use the **SKILL ROW COLORS** category switch. The right-hand Skills panel keeps its existing appearance.

Printed roundtime penalties accumulate instead of replacing one another, including double attacks and fumbles. Text and GMCP are reconciled within a 0.5-second window to reduce duplicate counting; without game-provided delay event IDs, perfectly identifying each delay is not possible. After printed delay bursts, the HUD can send a quiet, throttled `delay` check to replace the countdown with the game's reported remaining time. It hides only a proven HUD-requested, isolated reply; manually entered `delay` results remain visible and also correct the countdown. Overlapping manual requests or uncertain ownership leave replies visible, and failed/timed-out checks pause automatic requests rather than continuously polling. Checks do not run during character-data collection, autorolling, or updates. Stale unchanged snapshots do not restart the countdown, and character exits/disconnects clear it. STAT combat fields and confirmed attack-strategy messages update immediately, including **Frenzied**, even if another command interrupts STAT.

## Autoroller session highs

**Autoroller session breakdown:** Options → Autoroller shows a live **SESSION BEST** table comparing each characteristic's target with its highest observed rank. Unreached minimums are highlighted, with a reminder every 100 named-stat rolls. These are observations, not proven race/class caps; minimums never change automatically. Use the SESSION BEST button or `rr stats` for a console copy. Arranged pools are tracked separately and never attributed to named stats.

## Local build and install

Run the local build command below before installing from `dist`; existing `dist` artifacts may contain an earlier version.

### One-time safe upgrade from 0.3.15 or older

Older HUD releases stored personal HUD files inside Mudlet's replaceable package directory. Before using `dghud update` from one of those releases, install the independent bridge once:

```lua
lua installPackage("https://github.com/wizzydizzy-ctrl/dragons-gate-staff-hud/releases/latest/download/DGHUDMigration.mpackage")
```

The bridge copies and byte-verifies personal chat history, settings, map collections, exports, and diagnostics into `DGHUDData`, preserves differing files as conflict copies, and then starts the normal update. The bridge itself never deletes source data, and it blocks package removal if the final sync fails. Releases 0.3.16 and newer already write mutable data outside the replaceable package and can continue to use `dghud update` normally.

```bash
python3 scripts/build.py --owner wizzydizzy-ctrl --repository dragons-gate-staff-hud
```

For a local development build, in the Dragons Gate Mudlet profile command line replace the path and run:

```lua
lua installPackage("/absolute/path/to/dragons-gate-staff-hud/dist/DragonsGateHUD.mpackage")
```

For a fresh installation with no existing HUD, install the current release directly with:

```lua
lua installPackage("https://github.com/wizzydizzy-ctrl/dragons-gate-staff-hud/releases/latest/download/DragonsGateHUD.mpackage")
```

This executes code from that release inside the current Mudlet profile. Use the official download URL above, and install packages only from sources you trust.

## Publishing

Maintainers: the release tag must match `src/defaults.lua` exactly (for example, `v0.3.90` for runtime `0.3.90`). Build and test the matching source before pushing a new tag to the configured repository. Documentation-only changes do not require a version bump or a release tag. GitHub Actions tests and attaches `DragonsGateHUD.mpackage`, `DGHUDRecovery.mpackage`, `DGHUDMigration.mpackage`, and `manifest.json` to the release. Release actions are pinned to immutable commits, use minimum scoped permissions, and publish GitHub OIDC-backed build-provenance attestations for every artifact. Verify downloads with `gh attestation verify DragonsGateHUD.mpackage --repo wizzydizzy-ctrl/dragons-gate-staff-hud` and `gh attestation verify DGHUDMigration.mpackage --repo wizzydizzy-ctrl/dragons-gate-staff-hud`.

The HUD owns only the package named `DragonsGateHUD`, runtime IDs it creates, and files under the profile's `DGHUDData` directory. It does not alter unrelated profile triggers, aliases, scripts, timers, keys, packages, modules, maps, or settings.

## Persistent top chatbox

The top-center chatbox (shown by default) records approved communication formats without gagging, replacing, or otherwise changing normal game output. Its history belongs to the Mudlet profile, so changing characters never swaps or clears it. Package upgrades carry the visible history, active filter, and reading position into the replacement HUD without repainting the preserved chat console. Its recognized categories are `ROOM`, `OWN`, `WHISPER`, `ESP`, `DRAGON`, `SECIAN`, `CONTACT`, `STAFF`, `COMBAT`, and `WORLD`; `ROOM` includes both nearby speech and your own outgoing speech, including direct forms such as `Eilan asks Atrax, "..."` and `You ask Atrax, "..."`. `STAFF` includes GUIDE/GM messages, staff voice/sends output, submitted idea reports, GUIDE assistance requests with their room and pending-request count, and assistance-request cancellations. Wrapped idea reports are assembled into one bounded entry. `PRIVATE` shows `WHISPER`, `ESP`, `DRAGON`, `SECIAN`, and `CONTACT` together. Each entry retains its exact category even when a combined filter is used.

The `WORLD` tab captures character arrivals and departures, such as `** Obatalla Ogoun just arrived in the world.` and `** Obatalla Ogoun has left the world.`. It also recognizes unexpected departures. Arrivals are green and departures are red in both WORLD chat and the main display; customize them under **OPTIONS → Color Settings → Text Styles → World arrivals / World departures**. WORLD starts included in ALL; turn it off under **OPTIONS → Chat Settings → Show in ALL** to keep those notices only in WORLD. Its own history remains saved, and WORLD sound alerts start off.

Use **OPTIONS → Chat Settings → Show Chatbox** to hide or show the entire chatbox. Hiding it expands the main display; chat capture and saved history continue. The profile remembers this choice across character changes, restarts, and updates.

Use **OPTIONS → Chat Settings → Show in ALL** to choose which sources are included in the combined `ALL` tab. All sources are shown there by default except `COMBAT`. These choices are saved across restarts and updates. A source that is hidden from `ALL` is still captured and remains available in its own tab; no history is deleted.

The default chat settings are:

```lua
chat = {
  enabled = true,
  visible = true,
  height_percent = 0.21,
  target_height = 240,
  min_height = 160,
  max_height = 320,
  visible_limit = 1000,
  dedupe_seconds = 3,
  timestamps = true,
}
```

User overrides merge into these defaults, including nested `chat` overrides, without discarding unknown personal settings. Prefer **OPTIONS → CHAT SETTINGS** for everyday changes. Advanced users can set an override in a Mudlet Lua script, then reload:

```lua
DGHUD.user_settings.chat = DGHUD.user_settings.chat or {}
DGHUD.user_settings.chat.height_percent = 0.25
DGHUD.user_settings.chat.timestamps = false
DGHUD.reload()
```

Setting `chat.enabled = false` disables the HUD-owned chat capture runtime. `visible_limit` bounds only memory: the disk log is never pruned by the HUD. Adjacent duplicate entries with matching category, speaker, target, and message are accepted only once within `dedupe_seconds`; later or non-adjacent repeats remain in the log.

### Custom capture triggers

Personal triggers remain yours. The HUD never creates, edits, or deletes them. A personal trigger can add a filterable custom category through the stable API:

```lua
DGHUD.chat.capture("QUEST", line)
```

Or send a message directly when the trigger already extracts the text:

```lua
DGHUD.chat.capture("EVENTS", "The invasion has started.")
```

Valid new categories automatically become available as filters. Calls made while the HUD is replacing itself during reload/update fail safely and do not send game commands or modify unrelated runtime.

### Storage, privacy, and diagnostics

Captured entries are append-only JSON Lines stored permanently under the active Mudlet profile data directory:

```text
<Mudlet home>/DGHUDData/chat/profile/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
```

The HUD keeps up to 1,000 recent entries per message source, so a busy COMBAT channel cannot erase ROOM, STAFF, or private conversations. Your own speech shares the ROOM allowance; custom categories share a separate bounded allowance. Each displayed tab shows up to 1,000 matching entries, with ALL choices applied before that display limit. Older dated logs remain intact. Profile-wide loading also reads prior character-named chat directories, combines entries chronologically, and removes exact duplicates in memory; future entries are written to `chat/profile`. Reloading, updating, rolling back, or uninstalling the HUD does not delete these files. Use the confirmed saved-history clear action only when you want to permanently remove them.

Private communications such as whispers, ESP, Dragon, Secian, and Contact traffic are saved locally in these plain JSONL files. Anyone with access to your Mudlet profile, computer account, backups, or copied profile data may be able to read them. The HUD does not transmit chat logs, but you should treat the directory as sensitive local data.

Run `dghud chatstatus` to print the active filter, the current visible-entry count, the `profile` storage key, and the most recent storage error (`none` when no storage error has occurred in the running chat session).

Options → Support → Feedback & Requests opens an in-game form for anonymous feedback or feature requests. Support also provides one-click submission of the latest privacy-safe debug report. Neither action opens a browser or requires a GitHub account. The player chooses the feedback type, enters a short summary and detailed description, and receives a reference after submission. The form warns players not to include passwords or private account information; submissions are rate-limited and published to the DGHUD GitHub project for review.

The community map library also stays inside the HUD. `dghud map library` opens the same built-in browser as Map Settings → Map Library, map sharing uses anonymous review submission, and `dghud map debug` sends its privacy-safe mapper diagnostic directly. Local backup and diagnostic-folder commands remain local and never upload automatically.

## Embedded automapper

The native Mudlet map is embedded in the lower-left HUD immediately above the compass. While the mapper is enabled, each valid `gmcp.Room.Info.num` is the canonical Dragons Gate room ID. Revisiting that GMCP number refreshes safe descriptive data on the same native room; it never creates a duplicate or relocates its saved area, partition, or coordinates. Walking through the twelve standard directions (`n`, `ne`, `e`, `se`, `s`, `sw`, `w`, `nw`, `up`, `down`, `in`, and `out`) discovers rooms, creates advertised exit stubs, and confirms links only after the destination room arrives through GMCP. Teleports do not invent links.

Rapidly entered directions are retained in order until each corresponding GMCP room update arrives. A failed direction removes only that queued step, so fast sequences such as `north`, `north`, `west` do not lose their origin or create accidental isolated areas.

Confirmed compass exits keep their literal visual direction. If a newly discovered west, southwest, or other directional room would occupy an existing square, the mapper expands the DGHUD-owned grid outward and reserves the exact destination square instead of placing the new room at an unrelated nearest opening. Cardinal expansion inserts a row or column; diagonal expansion shifts both outward axes. Coordinate changes are ownership-checked and rolled back together if Mudlet rejects a move. Room IDs and saved exits never change.

By default, a confirmed special-travel command keeps a newly discovered destination on the current map and places it in a sensible free space beside the room you left. Separate destination-rooted submaps such as `special:900` are opt-in for each travel type under Map Settings; directional exploration remains in that partition even if Dragons Gate changes its area label. The built-in classifier accepts `go gate`, `go door`, `go portal`, `go arch`, `go path`, and conservative traversal verbs including `enter`, `leave`, `climb`, `crawl`, `cross`, `board`, and `disembark`. Normal gameplay commands cannot create phantom special exits. If the destination GMCP number is already canonical, the mapper preserves that room's saved partition and coordinates and records only the observed one-way special edge from the current origin. A command is confirmed only when a different canonical GMCP room arrives within twelve seconds. A later command replaces the candidate, and expiry, wrong direction, disconnect, reload, shutdown, or mapper disablement clears it. The mapper records only the normalized observed one-way command. It does not invent a reverse special connection; the return edge appears only after its own command and destination are observed. An untracked room change within the same GMCP area remains in the current partition without inventing an exit; only an untracked cross-area jump starts an isolated destination-rooted map.

The default mapper settings are:

```lua
mapper = {
  enabled = true,
  walk_timeout = 12,
  minimum_height = 90,
  schema = 1,
  special_timeout = 12,
  zoom_step = 2.5,
  zoom_min = 3.0,
  zoom_max = 60.0,
}
```

Nested user overrides and unknown future settings are preserved during merge and migration. Set `DGHUD.user_settings.mapper.enabled = false` and run `DGHUD.reload()` to disable discovery and walking. `walk_timeout` controls how many seconds a sent movement command waits for its expected room update. `minimum_height` sets the visible mapper floor when the window can accommodate it; wide layouts retain a 140-pixel responsive floor, while medium layouts default to 90 pixels. If the configured floor cannot fit without overlapping essential HUD content, the mapper hides cleanly.

Click a known destination in the embedded map or use:

```text
walkto 176
walkstop
mapcenter
dghud mapstatus
```

Walking sends exactly one command at a time and waits for the expected GMCP room number. Standard directions are normalized; a non-direction route step is sent only when its exact origin, destination, and command match a confirmed HUD-owned special exit. This allows `walkto` and owned native-map clicks to cross safe mixed directional/special routes without trusting an unobserved portal, door, gate, arch, or other command. After arrival, nonzero tracked roundtime pauses the route. It can resume when the local countdown expires, without waiting for a fresh zero Vitals packet; changed GMCP snapshots also correct the countdown. The per-step movement timeout is canceled while paused because no command is in flight; a fresh timeout starts only when the next command is sent. Wrong directions, unexpected rooms, manual movement, disconnection, timeout, and shutdown stop the route.

The HUD's optional **OPTIONS → Keybindings** panel can create temporary, HUD-owned number-pad controls. It starts off, never replaces personal Mudlet keys, and removes only the temporary keys it created. On macOS, use the numeric keypad normally; on Windows, keep Num Lock on.

The mapper toolbar owns four controls: `−` zooms out, the center control recenters on the current canonical room, `+` zooms in, and `MAP SETTINGS` opens the mapper controls. Guarded current-map and clear-all actions live inside that settings box. Zoom uses Mudlet's native area-specific value, so each normal area and special sub-map retains its own level across room changes, HUD reloads, updates, and profile restarts. Configured steps and bounds are enforced independently for the current saved area.

The HUD tags only its own rooms and areas with `dghud.owner=DragonsGateHUD`. It refuses to rewrite an existing unowned room or area and never deletes personal map data. Successfully owned map data is eligible for deletion only through the explicit, confirmed cleanup controls described below; failed creations may also be rolled back transactionally. Discovered canonical rooms, partitions, observed exits, coordinates, and native per-area zoom otherwise remain when the HUD reloads, updates, or is uninstalled. `dghud mapstatus` reports only whether mapping is enabled, the current room, the number of rooms managed during the HUD session, an active walking destination, the latest mapper status, and the latest actual mapper error. Routine stops such as `walkstop`, manual movement, route replacement, and shutdown update the status but do not overwrite the last error. It does not dump room names, routes, personal map records, or unrelated data.

### Safe map cleanup

Cleanup previews prefer secure token entropy from `/dev/urandom`. On hosts without that device, DGHUD uses a bounded local confirmation token; ownership, membership, inbound exits, movement state, and the complete preview are still re-read before any mutation. Tokens expire after 30 seconds, are one-use, and never weaken the rule that personal or unowned map content is excluded.

To repair incorrectly generated HUD map content, run `walkstop` first. Move out of a room before deleting only that room. The current map command intentionally includes and then recreates your current room from live GMCP. Preview exactly one scope:

```text
dghud map delete room 176
dghud map clear submap 900
dghud map clear area Dragons Gate - Training Grounds
dghud map clear current
dghud map clear all
```

Map Settings provides the same `clear all` operation. Its first click previews every DGHUD-owned area and room and changes the action to `CLICK AGAIN TO CLEAR ALL`; click it again within 30 seconds to delete that exact revalidated set. The current room is then recreated immediately from live GMCP so mapping starts fresh. Unowned and personal Mudlet map content is never included.

Inspect the resolved area and every exact room ID in the preview. If anything is unexpected, run `dghud map cancel`. Otherwise, confirm with the printed one-use command within 30 seconds:

```text
dghud map confirm <token>
```

The HUD refuses cleanup when ownership, map membership, inbound personal exits, or movement state is unsafe or has changed since preview. There is no force option. After successful cleanup, revisit the deleted canonical rooms to let normal GMCP exploration map them again. If deletion stops partway, keep the exact deleted, failed, and untouched IDs from the result, move to a safe room, and create a fresh preview before retrying.

Updating with `dghud update` replaces only the `DragonsGateHUD` package code. It preserves native map records, chat logs, user settings, and unrelated Mudlet scripts, aliases, triggers, packages, and map content.

The separate `DGHUDRecovery` companion package owns `dghud recover`. It survives replacement or removal of the main HUD and can download and reinstall a clean current release while preserving profile data and the automatic-update preference.
