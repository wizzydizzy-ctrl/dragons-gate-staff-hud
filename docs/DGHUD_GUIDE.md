# Complete DGHUD Guide

Applies to DGHUD **v0.3.94**. Older screenshots and messages may use different labels.

DGHUD is a Mudlet HUD for Dragons Gate. It organizes important character information, communication, navigation, and utility tools around the normal game display. It does not replace Dragons Gate commands, and it does not require you to edit Lua scripts for ordinary use.

This page is the main guide. Use the links below to open a detailed guide for each part of the HUD.

## Start here

If DGHUD is not installed yet, follow [Installation and First Start](INSTALLATION_AND_FIRST_START.md).

If DGHUD is already installed, the three most useful commands are:

```text
dghud help
dghud refresh
dghud check
```

- `dghud help` opens the built-in command guide.
- `dghud refresh` refreshes character information without reinstalling anything.
- `dghud check` checks whether a newer release exists without installing it.

To install a newer release, run `dghud update`. If it reports that you are already current, nothing is reinstalled. Use `dghud refresh` for stale character information instead.

## What's new in v0.3.94

- Inventory now has **Equipped** and **Carried** tabs. Each keeps its own saved list, so switching is immediate and does not send another game command.
- Current unnumbered inventory rows and nested locations such as **legs (pants)** are captured correctly. Duplicates remain separate.
- Gold, silver, and Carry remain your character's totals on either tab. Small windows retain scrollable items and totals without shrinking the font.
- **Water: Dehydrated** is shown as a red warning. Inventory refreshes no longer lift the tabs over an open settings window.
- Long rune names expand the scrollable list so the full name and weave count remain visible in narrow windows.

See [Inventory, money, and carrying capacity](HUD_SCREEN_AND_CHARACTER_DATA.md#inventory-money-and-carrying-capacity) for the new tabs, or read the [release notes](https://github.com/wizzydizzy-ctrl/dragons-gate-staff-hud/releases/tag/v0.3.94).

With **SKILL FILTERS ON**, filtering remains independent of custom or disabled colors and works with MAIN SKILLS off, preserving the game's row format and order. Main-display and sidebar sorting remain independent.

## A quick tour of the screen

- **Header:** DGHUD version, all 11 characteristics, real time, and synchronized game time.
- **Top-center chatbox:** Saved communication with category filters.
- **Center:** The normal Dragons Gate game display.
- **Bottom-center:** Resource bars without covering the command line.
- **Identity and navigation side:** Name, race, profession or dragon stage, physical details, faith, favors, alignment, hunger, thirst, equipment readiness, location, mapper, compass, travel buttons, and the roundtime bar.
- **Information side:** Combat, inventory and money, runes, and skills. Lists gain scrollbars when their contents do not fit.

DGHUD responds to window resizing. At smaller sizes, optional sections may hide so the game display and command line remain usable. This does not erase their data.

## What happens after character login

After Dragons Gate prints the character welcome message, DGHUD gathers information once, in sequence:

```text
inventory
stat
info
info religion
info magic
skill
time
```

The game may not provide all of this through GMCP, so DGHUD combines structured GMCP data with these command responses. It also captures the same commands when you enter them manually. Use `dghud refresh` to run the complete sequence again.

## Safe-use rules

- Use `dghud check` when you only want to check for an update.
- Automatic updating is off by default. Turning it on is optional, and your choice survives updates.
- DGHUD never sends `done` during character rolling. You make the final choice.
- Stop automatic walking with `walkstop` before cleaning or replacing a map.
- Read map cleanup and replacement previews before confirming them.
- Do not include passwords, private account information, or private conversations in feedback forms.
- DGHUD owns its own package resources and data. It is designed not to edit personal triggers, aliases, scripts, keys, packages, or unrelated maps.

Saved choices belong to the Mudlet profile, not the individual character. A different profile has its own preferences, chat history, and map collections.

## Getting help quickly

Open **OPTIONS → HELP & COMMANDS** or enter:

```text
dghud help
```

For a problem that the normal fixes do not solve, open **OPTIONS → SUPPORT**. You can send feedback or a privacy-safe diagnostic without a GitHub account.
